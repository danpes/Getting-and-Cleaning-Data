# Course 3 "Getting and Cleaning Data" - week 4 assignment

# Assignment
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article (http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/). 
Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. 
The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Here are the data for the project:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5) Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Steps to work on this course project
Just run source("run_analysis.R"). It will
- get dataset from source, unzip it (you'll have a local dir named 'UCI HAR Dataset'), remove the previously downloaded zip file
- create a new file tiny_data.txt in your working directory.
